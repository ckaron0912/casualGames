			<h1><em>Finger of God / Touch Defense (title TBD)</em></h1>
			
			<section>
				<h2>High Concept</h2>
				<p>Touch Defense is a twist on the tower defense game genre -- instead of building towers to defend your units, players will use their "finger of god" to tap and protect their units from enemies.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Genre</h2>
				<p>Tower Defense (with finger taps replacing towers)</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Platform</h2>
				<p>We will be developing this game for mobile only.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Story</h2>
				<p>We are still determining the story of the game but will most likely leave it abstract.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
				<p>We are considering either a medieval theme or a totally abstract theme similar to <i>Geometry Wars</i>. We do know that we do NOT want to use pixel art again.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<h3>Mechanics</h3>
				<p>The player taps the screen to defeat enemies and prevent them from killing their units:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>player units and enemies follow a given path</li>
						<li>paths can differ in length and shape</li>
						<li>enemies can be slower or faster, have more or less health</li>
						<li>possible power ups to help the player clear the screen</li>
					</ul>
		
				
				<h3>Control</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>touch</li>
					<li>accelerometer (maybe)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Onboarding</h3>
				<p>We plan to teach the player one or two mechanics at a time in order to let the player get used to the controls and what they can do.</p>
			
				<h3>Player Learning</h3>
				<p>The player will need to learn how to tap the screen to kill enemies and possibly how to use power-ups effectively.</p>

				<h2>Other</h2>
				<p>We will be using the Phaser game library to create the game.</p>
