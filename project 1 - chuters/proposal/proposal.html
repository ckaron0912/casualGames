				<h2>High Concept</h2>
				<p>The goal of the game is to safely land as many parachuters (or "chuters") as you can on the target below before running out of reinforcements. If your chuter misses the target or is shot down, you will lose a life (called "reinforcements"). Obstacles such as enemy tank fire and dynamic wind elements will make this challenge increasingly difficult until the player fails. To add more depth to the game, a chain reaction element will be incorporated--if a player can successfully land a specified number of chuters in a row, they will trigger a bombing run and blow up the enemies on the ground. This is an unwinnable, never-ending game that challenges players to attain higher scores.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Genre</h2>
				<p>Chuters is a blend of the chain reaction and avoidance game genres.
				</p>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Platform</h2>
				<p>We are initially targeting the desktop platform.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Story</h2>
				<p>There is no specific story in Chuters as the players are only trying to land as many "chuters" as they can and the game continues.</p>
				<p>Players must avoid incoming enemy fire to succeed, and successfully landing "chuters" consecutively will generate rewards for the player.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Esthetics</h2>
				<p>We will be using 8-bit pixel art graphics for the game.</p>
				<p>There will be ambient background music that is not too slow.</p>
				<p>Some of the types of sound will include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>score on landing</li>
                    <li>battle sounds</li>
                </ul>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<h3>Mechanics</h3>
                <p>The player will have to decide on the fly which direction to fall and possibly how fast. The player will be avoiding bullets while trying to safely land on a specific point.</p>
				
				<h3>Control</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Keyboard arrows for movement</li>
					<li>Possible other keys for rewards or power-ups (will update when decided)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Onboarding and Teaching the game</h3>
                <p>The basic controls will be initially displayed to the user.</p>
                
				<h3>Player learning</h3>
				<p>The player will need to learn what to avoid to make a safe landing.</p>
